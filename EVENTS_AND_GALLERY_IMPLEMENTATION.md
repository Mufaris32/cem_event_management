# Events Tab and Gallery Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a new "Events" tab in the navbar and updated the Gallery page to show images grouped by past events only.

## New Features Implemented

### 1. Events Tab in Navbar
- Added a new "Events" tab between "Home" and "Calendar" 
- Uses a List icon for visual consistency
- Routes to `/events` page

### 2. Events Page (`/src/pages/EventsPage.jsx`)
- **Purpose**: Shows all past and future events in a list format
- **Features**:
  - Displays events sorted by date (newest first)
  - Filter options: All Events, Upcoming Events, Past Events
  - Category filters: Cultural, Sports, Workshop, Seminar, Conference, Competition
  - Search functionality by title, description, and venue
  - Event cards show:
    - Event image (if available)
    - Title, category, and date
    - Venue and participant limits
    - Brief description
    - "View Details" button linking to individual event pages

### 3. Updated Gallery Page (`/src/pages/GalleryPage.jsx`)
- **Purpose**: Shows images grouped by past events only
- **Key Changes**:
  - Now fetches only past events using `getPastEvents()`
  - Groups images by event using Cloudinary folder structure
  - Each past event has its own expandable section
  - Images are organized in folders named after events (sanitized titles)
  - Modal view for individual images
  - Search functionality for past events

### 4. Enhanced Image Service (`/src/services/imageService.js`)
- Added new functions to work with Cloudinary folders:
  - `getImagesFromFolder(folderPath)`: Fetch images from a specific folder
  - `getFoldersInDirectory(parentPath)`: Get all folders in a directory
  - `getImagesFromEventFolders(eventNames, basePath)`: Get images for multiple events

## Cloudinary Folder Structure
For the gallery to work properly, images should be organized in Cloudinary as follows:
```
events/
├── cultural_fest_2024/
│   ├── image1.jpg
│   ├── image2.jpg
│   └── ...
├── sports_day_2024/
│   ├── image1.jpg
│   ├── image2.jpg
│   └── ...
└── tech_workshop_series/
    ├── image1.jpg
    ├── image2.jpg
    └── ...
```

## Folder Naming Convention
Event folder names are automatically generated from event titles by:
1. Converting to lowercase
2. Removing special characters
3. Replacing spaces with underscores
4. Trimming whitespace

Example: "Cultural Fest 2024!" → "cultural_fest_2024"

## Navigation Structure
Updated navigation flow:
- **Home** → Landing page
- **Events** → List of all events (new)
- **Calendar** → Calendar view of events
- **Gallery** → Past event images grouped by event (updated)
- **Admin** → Admin login

## Technical Implementation Details

### Routes Added
- `/events` → EventsPage component

### Dependencies
- Uses existing services: `eventServiceClient.js`, `imageService.js`
- Leverages Framer Motion for animations
- Uses Lucide React icons for UI elements

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when Cloudinary images are not available
- Loading states and error messages
- Fallback when no images exist for an event

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-friendly grid layouts
- Responsive image galleries
- Touch-friendly interactions

## Usage Instructions

### For Users
1. **Events Page**: Browse all events, filter by time/category, search by keywords
2. **Gallery Page**: View past event photos organized by event, click to expand, modal view for larger images

### For Administrators
1. **Adding Events**: Use the existing admin dashboard to create events
2. **Adding Gallery Images**: Upload images to Cloudinary in folders named after events
   - Folder structure: `events/{sanitized_event_title}/`
   - Supported formats: JPG, JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP

## Benefits
1. **Better Organization**: Events and gallery are now separate with clear purposes
2. **Enhanced User Experience**: Easy browsing of all events in one place
3. **Improved Gallery**: Images are meaningfully grouped by events
4. **Scalable**: Cloudinary folder structure supports unlimited events and images
5. **Search and Filter**: Users can quickly find specific events or time periods

## Future Enhancements

- Add social sharing for gallery images
- Include event ratings and reviews
- Add pagination for large numbers of events/images
