# CEM Event Management - Project Status

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. Network Connection Errors
- **Problem**: Frontend was getting "AxiosError: Network Error" when trying to connect to backend
- **Solution**: Re-engineered backend from scratch, removed redundant files, created unified Express.js server
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Backend running on port 3001, frontend on port 5174

### 2. Event Creation Validation Errors
- **Problem**: Missing required fields causing validation errors:
  - `organizer.email: Organizer email is required`
  - `organizer.name: Organizer name is required`
  - `location.city: City is required`
  - `location.address: Event address is required`
- **Solution**: Updated AdminEventForm.jsx to include proper form fields for nested objects
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Form now includes all required fields

### 3. React Rendering Errors
- **Problem**: "Objects are not valid as a React child" errors from displaying object properties
- **Solution**: Fixed object rendering in AdminDashboard.jsx to properly display nested properties
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - All object properties properly rendered as strings

### 4. Image Upload Issues
- **Problem**: API expected array of image files but form was passing single file
- **Solution**: Updated AdminDashboard.jsx to convert single image file to array format
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Image uploads now work correctly

### 5. Database Initialization
- **Problem**: No sample data for testing
- **Solution**: Created init-database.js script with sample events
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Database seeded with 5 sample events

## 🚀 Current Architecture

### Backend (Port 3001)
- Express.js 4.18.2 server
- MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- CORS-enabled for frontend connections
- RESTful API endpoints for events and image uploads
- Proper error handling and validation

### Frontend (Port 5174)
- React 18 with Vite development server
- Updated API client pointing to port 3001
- Enhanced AdminEventForm with all required fields
- Fixed React rendering issues

### Database
- MongoDB running locally
- Sample events loaded and ready for testing
- Proper schema validation enforced

## 📝 New Form Fields Added

The AdminEventForm.jsx now includes:

### Location Information (Required)
- Street Address *
- City *
- State
- ZIP Code

### Organizer Information (Required)
- Organizer Name *

2. Modify fields and save
3. Changes should be reflected immediately

### 4. Test Event Deletion
1. Click the delete button on any event
2. Confirm deletion
3. Event should be removed from the list

## 🔧 Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Backend (Terminal 1)
cd "e:\Projects\New_CEM\cem_event_management-"
$env:PORT=3001; node server.js

# Frontend (Terminal 2)
cd "e:\Projects\New_CEM\cem_event_management-"
npm run dev
```

## 📊 API Endpoints Working

- ✅ GET /health - Health check
- ✅ GET /api/events - Get all events
- ✅ GET /api/events/upcoming - Get upcoming events
- ✅ GET /api/events/past - Get past events
- ✅ GET /api/events/statistics - Get event statistics
- ✅ POST /api/events - Create new event
- ✅ PUT /api/events/:id - Update event
- ✅ DELETE /api/events/:id - Delete event
- ✅ POST /api/upload/images - Upload images

## 🎯 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Authentication**: Implement proper JWT-based authentication
2. **Image Optimization**: Add image compression and multiple formats
3. **Search & Filtering**: Enhanced search capabilities
4. **Email Notifications**: Send emails for event updates
5. **Calendar Integration**: Export events to external calendars
6. **Mobile App**: React Native version
7. **Analytics**: Advanced event analytics and reporting

## 🐛 Known Issues (Minor)

1. Port 5000 might be blocked by Windows - using port 3001 instead
2. Hot reload might require manual refresh after major changes
3. Image preview sometimes requires double-click on upload

## 💡 Development Notes

- Server automatically restarts on file changes (nodemon)
- Frontend has hot module replacement enabled
- CORS configured for both ports (5173 and 5174)
- MongoDB connection with automatic reconnection
- Proper error boundaries and validation throughout
