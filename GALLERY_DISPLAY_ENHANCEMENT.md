# Event Gallery Display Enhancement

## Changes Made

### Problem
Previously, past events with gallery images displayed small 3x3 thumbnail grids, which didn't utilize the full container space effectively and made it difficult to see the event photos clearly.

### Solution
Changed the display logic for past events with gallery images:

1. **Full Cover Image**: The first uploaded gallery image now displays as a full-width cover image (same size as regular event images - h-48)

2. **Gallery Indicators**: Added visual indicators to show this is a gallery:
   - **Top-right counter**: Shows the total number of photos with a camera icon
   - **Bottom-left badge**: "Event Gallery" label with photo icon

3. **Interactive Hover Effects**:
   - Image scales slightly on hover
   - Overlay appears with "Click to view all photos" message
   - Badge colors intensify on hover

4. **Enhanced Action Button**:
   - Shows "View Gallery" instead of "View Details" for past events with photos
   - Added photo count badge next to the action button

### Visual Hierarchy
- **Upcoming Events**: Show regular event image
- **Past Events with Gallery**: Show first gallery image as cover with gallery indicators
- **Events without Images**: Show placeholder

### User Experience Improvements
- Better utilization of container space
- Clear indication that more photos are available
- Consistent image sizing across all events
- More engaging visual presentation for past events

### Technical Implementation
- Maintained all existing functionality
- Added conditional rendering based on event status and gallery availability
- Preserved image lazy loading and error handling
- Enhanced hover states and transitions
